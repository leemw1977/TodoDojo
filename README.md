# Todo Dojo

Welcome to a task list app designed with self-control to allow you to take control of your todo's - both personal and business.

It's very early days

## Work under way
* Currently the basics - adding, editing, listing tasks - trying to identify what we need to see most regularly etc.

## Anticipated features - aka selfish view of what the author needs
* Connection to your google calendar
* Topological sorting of tasks
* Arranging tasks into relevant blocks - i.e. personal tasks to your personal schedule, business to your work schedule.

## Security
I've setup GPG signing - this amendment to the README.md is to confirm this is functioning as anticipated.
